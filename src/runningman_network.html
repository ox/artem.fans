  <h1>Runningman Network</h1>
  <p>This project aims to re-create an OSCAR server that vintage AIM clients (v1, v3.1) could connect to and chat on. I
    see this as a software revival, which opens the doors to expanding the original technology in ways it was not meant
    to be used.</p>
  <p>I run a hosted service at <a href="https://runningman.network">runningman.network</a> where you can <a
      href="https://runningman.network/register">register for an account</a> and begin chatting after some short setup.
    A challenge getting anyone to use this is getting the old clients to work on macOS, which involves installing
    VirtualBox and using the provided image. I tried to make it as seamless as possible but it's a big ask for some
    users. Surprisingly Windows 10 will gladly install the old clients and run them as if nothing has changed in 20
    years.</p>
  <p>I hope to fill out capability for all of the various features that AIM originally supported like groups and away
    messages. In the future I hope to implement federation so that users can chat across servers, something that the
    original service was never intended to do.</p>
